# Generative-Neural-Networks
 In this project, I will implement a generative neural network, more precisely a Variational Autoencoder (VAE).
 
 ## Description
The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is the extended part of the
traditional autoencoder and this methods are mostly used in
deep generative network models capable of learning unsupervised
latent representations of data. We designing a VAE-based
generative model which is capable of extracting features correlated
to binary labels in the data and structuring it in a latent
subspace which is easy to interpret. Here, we implement this
model to generate images of digits between 0 and 9.
